# SecureNotes

## Setup and Installation

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/YaqubRahman/SecureNotes.git>
```

## More infomation in the frontend and backend folders

## Note on production-grade improvements if I had more time

- Would use a database for the notes rather than use an in-memory array
- Would also use a database to support different users
- Would improve syling and make UI more responsive for other devices (e.g phones)
- Would add better validation for both the frontend and backend
- Would of considered adding more features including grouping notes and setting colours of notes
